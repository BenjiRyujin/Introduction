Hello! My name is Benjamin Ryujin and I am a fourth year UC San Diego student majoring in Cognitive Science Design and Interaction and minoring in Computer Science.

# Design

Professionally, I have an interest in design. Specifically, how to best design and create goods and services that push society towards a better future. I have had experience designing websites for a San Diego Lebanese-Mediterranean restaurant, [Amardeen](https://www.figma.com/proto/gEobvcJfpy4sqYNO3ZrNRW/187B-File?page-id=418%3A48&node-id=843-768&starting-point-node-id=418%3A439&mode=design&t=jStalitUY7tVtHgY-1), and a potential [website](https://www.figma.com/proto/lPqWITfVVQr1qBU6g1kWEt/CSE-170-Finalized-build?page-id=0%3A1&node-id=6-165&starting-point-node-id=6%3A165&scaling=contain&mode=design&t=TPUsU133me0V8Qb4-1) for a company that streamlines the self-checkout process for store owners.  I've also designed novel interfaces for text-to-image generative models. 

# Code

Here is some sample code I will use to push these changes from my local repo to the remote repo on Github:

```
git add
git commit -m "message"
git push origin <branch-name>
```

I am also interested in the front end development of websites and applications. I have basic familiarity with HTML, CSS, and vanilla Javascript, and am actively seeking opportunities to grow more as a developer as well as a designer.

# Photography

Photography was one of my first entry points into the world of design. I love to take pictures—here is a link to my [photography portfolio](https://benjiryujin.myportfolio.com/).

# Badminton

I love playing badminton after picking it up my junior year of high school. I've been playing for the UCSD badminton club every since and I've made some great friends while doing so.

Here is a list of my top favorite badminton rackets
1. Astrox 88D Pro
2. Nanoflare 800 
3. Arcsaber 11 Pro
4. Astrox 88S
5. Victor Bravesword 12


# Guitar

In my free time I like to learn and play the guitar! I am into playing a lot of R&B and Korean indie songs, such as those from Daniel Caesar, Jukjae, Sam Kim, and more.

My favorite song to play is a Korean song called [Tattoo](https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/3B4AOfW6nDbCPb1pIEczJQ?utm_source=generator) by Jukjae.


# Poetry

In addition to photography, I find it beautiful to express myself through words as well. 

### My Favorite Haiku
> _Solitary now ——_
> 
> _Amidst the blossom_
> 
> _Is a cypress tree_
